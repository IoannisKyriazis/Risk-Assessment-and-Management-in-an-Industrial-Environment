# Risk Assessment and Management in an Industrial Environment.

In this paper, we are asked to prepare a comprehensive proposal for a security plan for a company that processes personal data, without any knowledge of network and information system security. We rely on the topology and segmentation of the network given to us. As part of the work, we must deal exclusively with the protection of the company's equipment (marked with a black box in the diagram). Each asset in the diagram has a name and the subnet it belongs to with its IP.
